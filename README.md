# Decentralized Autonomous Artist (DAA): A Fusion of Art, AI, and FHE ðŸš€ðŸŽ¨

The Decentralized Autonomous Artist (DAA) is a groundbreaking project that leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology** to empower an AI artist capable of creating unique and unpredictable artworks. This innovative system operates on-chain, securely learning from the entirety of public art history and generating new pieces that are sold as NFTs. The revenue generated from these sales is utilized to sustain the artist's ongoing operations, creating a self-sustaining art ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

In the rapidly evolving digital art landscape, artists often struggle to gain recognition and financial stability. Traditional art systems can be opaque and biased, leaving many talented creators overlooked. Moreover, emerging technologies, such as AI, raise concerns about authenticity and ownership in art creation. The need for an autonomous artist that can operate independently of the traditional art world's pitfalls is more pressing than ever.

## The FHE Solution

FHE provides a transformative solution to the challenges in the art world by enabling the creation and management of digital art in a secure and confidential manner. By utilizing **Zama's open-source libraries** like **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, DAA allows the AI artist to learn from an extensive dataset of public art without compromising any sensitive information. This means that the artist can generate art pieces that are not only unique but also preserve the privacy of the underlying data, thereby addressing concerns of imitation and ownership.

Through Zama's FHE, the DAA operates as an independent economic entity, exploring the frontier of generative art while ensuring the integrity and unpredictability of the creative process.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Art Creation**: The DAA generates new art pieces using advanced machine learning techniques, learning from the entirety of public art history.
- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**: Safeguards the entire creation process, ensuring that art generation is secure and private.
- **NFT Marketplace**: Artworks are minted as NFTs, enabling ownership transfer and authenticity verification on the blockchain.
- **Self-Sustaining Model**: Revenue from the sale of artworks is reinvested into the DAA, ensuring growth and sustainability.
- **Exploration of AI as an Independent Artist**: Investigate and push the boundaries of AI in the realm of creativity and economic agency.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK**: The primary component for secure and confidential computing.
- **Node.js**: For the server-side runtime environment.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: Development frameworks for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Solidity**: The programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **AI Libraries**: For the implementation of artistic generation algorithms.

## Installation Guide

To get started with the Decentralized Autonomous Artist, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Project**: Ensure you have the project files on your local machine (do not use `git clone`).
2. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your system.
   - Install **Hardhat** or **Foundry** as per your preference for Ethereum development.
3. **Set Up the Project**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will fetch all the necessary dependencies, including the required Zama FHE libraries.

## Build & Run Guide

Once you have set up your project, you can compile, test, and run it with the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. **Run the Tests**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
3. **Deploy the Smart Contract**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

Hereâ€™s a code snippet demonstrating how the AI artist generates a new artwork:

```javascript
const { generateArtwork } = require('./src/ai_art_generator');
const { encryptArtData } = require('./src/encryption_utils');

async function createNewArt() {
    const newArtwork = await generateArtwork();
    const encryptedArtwork = encryptArtData(newArtwork);

    console.log("New artwork created and encrypted: ", encryptedArtwork);
}

// Call the function to create art
createNewArt();
```
